            People have different ways to compose and record music,
            soundtracks, melodies or sound effects. Even more variations
            come into play when arranging or artistically producing a song or a full album.
            For all types of audio productions, there comes a time
            when you finally need to mix all, independent recorded tracks down to one, two or more channels.
            The next step is to finish the formatting of the final mix
            and give it the last quality packaging by mastering the production.</p>
            <p>The audio production is now ready to be published, either
            electronically (broadcasting, download, streaming) or physically on a media support</p>

          <p>A phonograph disc record, or simply a
            phonograph record, gramophone record, disc record or record,
            is an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat disc with an
            inscribed, modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the periphery
            and ends near the center of the disc.</p>
            <p>The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used
              for music reproduction throughout the 20th century.
              It had co-existed with the phonograph cylinder from
              the late 1880s and had effectively superseded it by around 1912. </p>

        <article >
          <p>During the first half of the 1920s, engineers at Western Electric,
            as well as independent inventors such as Orlando Marsh, developed technology
            for capturing sound with a microphone, amplifying it with vacuum tubes,
            then using the amplified signal to drive an electromechanical recording head.
            Western Electric's innovations resulted in a broader and smoother frequency response,
            which produced a dramatically fuller, clearer and more natural-sounding recording.</p>
            <p>Electrically amplified record players were initially expensive and slow to be adopted.
              Gradually, electrical reproduction entered the home.
              The spring motor was replaced by an electric motor. The old sound box with its needle-linked
              diaphragm was replaced by an electromagnetic pickup that converted the needle vibrations into an electrical signal.
              The tone arm now served to conduct a pair of wires, not sound waves, into the cabinet.
              The exponential horn was replaced by an amplifier and a loudspeaker.</p>

        </header>
        <article >
          <p>Is a medium for magnetic recording, made of a thin, magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic film.
            Devices that record and playback audio and video using magnetic tape are tape recorders and video tape recorders respectively.
            A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape is known as a tape drive.
          </p>
          <p>Magnetic tape is usually recorded on only one side. The back side is a substrate that gives the tape strength and flexibility.
            The magnetic side or recording layer of most tapes is typically a metallic oxide called the oxide side, which is magnetized by a tape head to store the information.
            While good for short term use, magnetic tape is highly prone to disintegration. Depending on the environment, this process may begin after 10-20 years.

        <article>
          <p>The LP (from "long playing" or "long play") is an analog sound storage medium, a phonograph record format characterized by: a speed of 33+1⁄3 rpm; a 12- or 10-inch (30- or 25-cm) diameter;
            use of the "microgroove" groove specification; and a vinyl (a copolymer of vinyl chloride acetate) composition disk.
             Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry.</p>
             <p>Although the LP was suited to classical music because of its extended continuous playing time, it also allowed a collection of ten or more pop music recordings to be put on a single disc.
               Previously such collections, as well as longer classical music broken up into several parts, had been sold as sets of 78 rpm records in a specially imprinted "record album" consisting of individual record sleeves bound together in book form. The use of the word "album" persisted for the one-disc LP equivalent. </p>

        <article>
          <p>The Compact Cassette or Musicassette (MC), also commonly called the tape cassette, cassette tape, audio cassette, or simply tape or cassette, is an analog magnetic tape recording format for audio recording and playback.
            It was developed by the Dutch company Philips in Hasselt, Belgium, by Lou Ottens and his team.</p>
          <p>The compact cassette technology was originally designed for dictation machines, but improvements in fidelity led the Compact Cassette to supplant the stereo 8-track cartridge and reel-to-reel tape recording in most non-professional applications.
            Its uses ranged from portable audio to home recording to data storage for early microcomputers.</p>
          <p>Compact Cassettes contain two miniature spools, between which the magnetically coated, polyester-type plastic film (magnetic tape) is passed and wound. These spools and their attendant parts are held inside a protective plastic shell which is 4 by 2.5 by 0.5 inches (10 cm × 6.3 cm × 1.3 cm) at its largest dimensions.
            The tape itself is commonly referred to as "eighth-inch" tape, supposedly 1/8 inch (3.17 mm) wide, but it is slightly larger: 0.15 inches (3.81 mm).</p>

          <p>The compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format that was co-developed by Philips and Sony to store and play digital audio recordings</p>
          <p>Standard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres (4.7 in) and are designed to hold up to 74 minutes of uncompressed stereo digital audio or about 650 MB of data. Capacity is routinely extended to 80 minutes and 700 MB by arranging more data closely on the same sized disc.
            The Mini CD has various diameters ranging from 60 to 80 millimetres (2.4 to 3.1 in); they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering device drivers.</p>
          <p>At the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD could store much more data than a personal computer hard disk drive, which would typically hold 10 MB. By 2010, hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs, while their prices had plummeted to commodity level.
            In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs, and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide.</p>

        </header>
        <article>
          <p>Super Audio CD (SACD) is a read-only optical disc format for audio storage, introduced in 1999. It was developed jointly by Sony and Philips Electronics, and intended to be the successor to the Compact Disc (CD) format. </p>
          <p>The SACD format allows multiple audio channels (i.e. surround sound or multichannel sound). It also provides a higher bit rate and longer playing time than a conventional CD. An SACD is designed to be played on an SACD player. A hybrid SACD contains a Red Book Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) layer that can be played on a standard CD player. </p>
          <p>SACD discs have identical physical dimensions as standard compact discs. The areal density of the disc is the same as a DVD. There are three types of disc:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Hybrid: Hybrid SACDs have a 4.7 GB SACD layer (the HD layer), as well as a CD (Red Book) audio layer readable by most conventional Compact Disc players.</li>
            <li>Single-layer: A disc with one 4.7 GB SACD layer.</li>
            <li>Dual-layer: A disc with two SACD layers, totaling 8.5 GB, and no CD layer. Dual-layer SACDs can store nearly twice as much data as a single-layer SACD.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Unlike hybrid discs, both single- and dual-layer SACDs are incompatible with conventional CD players and cannot be played on them.</p>

                  WAV (Waveform Audio File Format)
                </header>
                <p>The WAV file is an instance of a Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) defined by IBM and Microsoft. The RIFF format acts as a "wrapper" for various audio coding formats. Though a WAV file can contain compressed audio,
                  the most common WAV audio format is uncompressed audio in the linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) format. LPCM is also the standard audio coding format for audio CDs, which store two-channel LPCM audio sampled at 44,100 Hz with 16 bits per sample.
                  Since LPCM is uncompressed and retains all of the samples of an audio track, professional users or audio experts may use the WAV format with LPCM audio for maximum audio quality. WAV files can also be edited and manipulated with relative ease using software.</p>
                <p>The top level definition of a WAV file is: </p>
                <code><WAVE-form> → RIFF('WAVE'
                   <fmt-ck>            // Format
                   [<fact-ck>]         // Fact chunk

                  Digital audio compressed by FLAC's algorithm can typically be reduced to between 50 and 70 percent of its original size and decompress to an identical copy of the original audio data. </p>
                <p>To encode WAV to FLAC we need to use in the CLI:</p>
                <code>flac --best abc.wav</code>
                <p>Resulting in a FLAC file with the highest compression rate.</p>

                  <p>Vorbis is a free and open-source software project headed by the Xiph.Org Foundation.
                    The project produces an audio coding format and software reference encoder/decoder (codec) for lossy audio compression. Vorbis is most commonly used in conjunction with the Ogg container format and it is therefore often referred to as Ogg Vorbis.
                    The Vorbis project started as part of the Xiphophorus company's Ogg project (also known as OggSquish multimedia project). Chris Montgomery began work on the project and was assisted by a growing number of other developers.
                    They continued refining the source code until the Vorbis file format was frozen for 1.0 in May 2000.[2][3][16] Originally licensed as LGPL, in 2001 the Vorbis license was changed to the BSD license to encourage adoption, with the endorsement of Richard Stallman.
                    A stable version (1.0) of the reference software was released on July 19, 2002.</p>
                  <p>To transcode from a Lossless source to an Ogg vorbis file, we can use the next command on the CLI:</p>
                  <code>ffmpeg -i musicfile.flac musicfile.ogg</code>

                  </header>
                  <p>Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) is an audio coding standard for lossy digital audio compression. Designed to be the successor of the MP3 format, AAC generally achieved higher sound quality than 20th century MP3 encoders at the same bit rate.
                    AAC supports inclusion of 48 full-bandwidth (up to 96 kHz) audio channels in one stream plus 16 low frequency effects (LFE, limited to 120 Hz) channels, up to 16 "coupling" or dialog channels, and up to 16 data streams. The quality for stereo is satisfactory to modest requirements at 96 kbit/s in joint stereo mode;
                    however, hi-fi transparency demands data rates of at least 128 kbit/s (VBR). Tests of MPEG-4 audio have shown that AAC meets the requirements referred to as "transparent" for the ITU at 128 kbit/s for stereo, and 320 kbit/s for 5.1 audio.</p>
                  <p>To transcode from a lossless source to an AAC file, wa can use the next command on the CLI:</p>
                  <code>ffmpeg -i input.flac -c:a libfdk_aac -vbr 3 output.m4a</code>

                  <p>Opus is a lossy audio coding format developed by the Xiph.Org Foundation and standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force, designed to efficiently code speech and general audio in a single format, while remaining low-latency enough for real-time interactive communication and low-complexity enough for low-end embedded processors.
                    Opus supports constant and variable bitrate encoding from 6 kbit/s to 510 kbit/s (or up to 256 kbit/s per channel for multi-channel tracks), frame sizes from 2.5 ms to 60 ms, and five sampling rates from 8 kHz (with 4 kHz bandwidth) to 48 kHz (with 20 kHz bandwidth, the human hearing range). An Opus stream can support up to 255 audio channels,
                    and it allows channel coupling between channels in groups of two using mid-side coding.</p>
                  <p>To transcode from a lossless source to an OPUS file, we can use the next command on the CLI, pairing it with the ffmpeg library:</p>
                  <code>ffmpeg -i infile.ext <options> outfile.opus</code>
